**AdTaxSys** is an innovative, purpose-built system designed to assist the **Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA)** in effectively managing the taxation of **billboards** and **promotional advertisements**, including **illuminated and non-illuminated billboards**, **digital screens**, and **advertising vehicles**.

## Problem Statement

TRA currently lacks a **dedicated platform** for managing advertisement taxation. While the existing Tax Revenue System allows generation of payment control numbers for taxpayers, it **does not capture or manage details** about the advertisement assets themselves.

### Real Operational Gaps:

* No system to register billboard dimensions, types, or locations
* No automation of tax calculations based on asset attributes
* Invoices are created manually using Word or Excel
* No linkage between taxpayer info and advertising assets
* No reporting or tracking of ad-related revenue
* Data is fragmented and difficult to audit

## How It Works

1. **User Inputs Asset Details**
   TRA staff or authorized agents enter detailed information about the advertisement asset into the system.

2. **Validation and Association**
   AdTaxSys fetches taxpayer information via TRA’s internal API using TIN and links the asset to its rightful owner.

3. **Tax Computation**
   Based on predefined rules, the system calculates the appropriate tax for each asset automatically.

4. **Invoice Generation**
   A digital invoice with a payment control number is created and linked to both the asset and the taxpayer's profile.

5. **Tracking and Monitoring**
   Ongoing tracking of all advertisement assets, tax statuses, payments, and expiration is maintained through the platform.

## Vision

To provide TRA with a **modern, intelligent, and scalable solution** for managing advertisement taxation — supporting the country’s tax base expansion, minimizing revenue leakages, and enhancing transparency and efficiency in tax administration.

## Origin and Impact

During my internship at TRA, I observed the serious operational inefficiencies in managing advertisement taxation. Manual invoice preparation through Microsoft Word, unstructured data collection, and reliance on non-digitized processes led to high revenue leakages and weak oversight.

I initially created a basic C# desktop tool to assist in generating invoices more quickly. However, that solution lacked the capacity for real integration, scalability, and institutional adoption.

**AdTaxSys** represents a fully upgraded system built on real-world gaps and institutional needs. It is designed to **revolutionize how TRA regulates, monitors, and taxes commercial advertisements** across Tanzania, paving the way for enhanced compliance, increased revenue, and improved taxpayer service delivery.
