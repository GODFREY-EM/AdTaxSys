# AdTaxSys: Advertisement Taxation Management System

## Overview

AdTaxSys is a comprehensive system designed to assist the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) in efficiently managing and regulating the taxation of billboards and promotional advertisements, including illuminated and non-illuminated billboards, as well as promotional vehicles. The system simplifies the process of registration, tracking, and calculating taxes, offering a user-friendly interface that enables TRA to enforce accurate billing and taxation.

## Key Features

* **Billboard Tax Management**: Allows TRA to register, track, and manage taxes for all types of billboards, including dimensions, location, and lighting specifications (illuminated and non-illuminated).
* **Promotional Vehicle Taxation**: Facilitates the management and taxation of promotional vehicles, helping TRA track vehicle details and location-based advertisement activities.
* **Automated Tax Calculation**: Automatically calculates taxes based on various factors like billboard size, location, and type (illuminated or non-illuminated).
* **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive platform for TRA officials to manage and update records, with quick access to important information.
* **Detailed Reporting**: Generates reports on billboards, vehicles, and total taxes collected, aiding in strategic planning and audits.
* **Integration with TRA Systems**: Seamlessly integrates with existing TRA systems for taxpayer registration and financial tracking.

## How It Works

1. **Billboard Registration**: Users can register billboards by entering details such as dimensions, location, lighting type, and ownership.
2. **Promotional Vehicle Registration**: Users can add vehicles running promotional advertisements, linking them to specific tax rates.
3. **Tax Calculation**: Based on registered data, the system calculates taxes owed by each billboard owner and promotional vehicle.
4. **Reporting and Audits**: Generate detailed reports that give insights into tax collections, outstanding payments, and billboardsâ€™ performance.
5. **Payments**: Easily track and process payments for billboard taxes and promotional vehicle taxes.
